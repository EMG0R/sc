For the project, I already have some super colliding sauce so I want to give it an epic UI and make it super controlable and accessible. Tt will also have drums and be super cool.

I will give it a UI knob for:

- odds of triggering
- pitch ADR
- FM ADR
- amp ADR
- distortion

maybe arranged so some of these combine or also control like the reverb

I am excited and I feel confident in my ability to get it done and make it fun.
